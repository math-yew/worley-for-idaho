      <p change="vision-2-p" class="paragraph-4 vision">It has become clear to a growing number of Americans that our nation is in the middle of an existential conflict between two incompatible worldviews and systems of political thought. However, this divide is much more than a "Left vs. Right" or partisan division; it is a division between those who want freedom and those who want total control.<br><br>The fight over Critical Race Theory (CRT) and critical gender theory exposed that<br><br>Leftist radicals now dominate the Democrat Party. These radicals fight for Marxist doctrines that are every bit as dangerous to the Republic as communism was during the Cold War. This new iteration of Marxism, Woke Communism, is the totalitarian political heresy of our age. Those who embrace Woke Communism cannot be reasoned with or appeased, like the Soviets of the last century; they must be defeated.<br><br><b>My vision is simple: we win, they lose.</b> There is no moral obligation to tolerate evil. I will directly confront this totalitarian ideology and its supporters.<br><br>God created us male and female, period. The mental and physical mutilation of boys and girls in the name of "transgenderism" is evil and must be stopped. Likewise, the propagation of sexual immorality in our schools also must be stopped.<br><br>In all its manifestations, Critical Race Theory is nothing more than a re-packaging of Marxism. It exploits and stokes race division to accomplish the same goals traditional Marxism sought through class division. This manifestation of Woke Communism is ideological poison and must be driven from our schools and universities.<br><br>If elected, I will use every power of my office and the platform it provides to expose, confront, and defeat Woke Communism in Idaho.<br><br>The time for half measures has passed. <b>It is time to Restore the Republic.</b><br><br>We must restore the Founding Fathers' ideals to their rightful place as the guiding principles of American government. This begins with reasserting the premise of the American Revolution found in the Declaration of Independence:<br><br>“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed...."<br><br>Our rights come from God, and the central purpose of government is to protect those rights. Every just power government has to accomplish this purpose comes from the consent of the people.<br><br>As your State Senator, I will fight to restore the ideals of the American Founding to their proper place as the guiding principles of our state government</p>
