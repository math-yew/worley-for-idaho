However, this divide is much more than a &#x22;Left vs. Right&#x22; or partisan division; it is a division between those who want freedom and those who want total control.<br><br>The fight over Critical Race Theory (CRT) and critical gender theory exposed that<br><br>Leftist radicals now dominate the Democrat Party. These radicals fight for Marxist doctrines that are every bit as dangerous to the Republic as communism was during the Cold War. This new iteration of Marxism, Woke Communism, is the totalitarian political heresy of our age. Those who embrace Woke Communism cannot be reasoned with or appeased, like the Soviets of the last century; they must be defeated.<br><br><b>My vision is simple: we win, they lose.</b> There is no moral obligation to tolerate evil. I will directly confront this totalitarian ideology and its supporters.<br><br>God created us male and female, period. The mental and physical mutilation of boys and girls in the name of &#x22;transgenderism&#x22; is evil and must be stopped. Likewise, the propagation of sexual immorality in our schools also must be stopped.<br><br>In all its manifestations, Critical Race Theory is nothing more than a re-packaging of Marxism. It exploits and stokes race division to accomplish the same goals traditional Marxism sought through class division. This manifestation of Woke Communism is ideological poison and must be driven from our schools and universities.<br><br>If elected, I will use every power of my office and the platform it provides to expose, confront, and defeat Woke Communism in Idaho.<br><br>The time for half measures has passed. <b>It is time to Restore the Republic.</b><br><br>We must restore the Founding Fathers&#x27; ideals to their rightful place as the guiding principles of American government. This begins with reasserting the premise of the American Revolution found in the Declaration of Independence:<br><br>&#x22;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. - That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed....&#x22;<br><br>Our rights come from God, and the central purpose of government is to protect those rights. Every just power government has to accomplish this purpose comes from the consent of the people.<br><br>As your State Senator, I will fight to restore the ideals of the American Founding to their proper place as the guiding principles of our state government","vision-3-h":"Copyright WorleyForIdaho.com","platform-1-h":"Platform","platform-2-h":"Transparency and Accountability","platform-3-p":"All government officers, elected and unelected, can justly govern only by the consent of the governed. In a Republic, the people choose their leaders at the ballot box, but also have a fundamental right to be involved in what their government does throughout an elected leader&#x27;s term of office.<br><br>City Hall belongs to the people. Time and space for public comment must be expanded and COVID-19 must not be used as an excuse to shut the people out. As your mayor I will ensure your voice is heard and I will fight for you in your city government.<br><br>As mayor I will task city officials with generating clear and concise reports that make it easy for the common citizen to see how and where their hard-earned tax dollars are being spent. I will also clearly identify whom city spending and policies benefit and whom they hurt. The citizens of Pocatello have a right to know how city policy actually impacts their community.<br><br>As your mayor I will serve the city as a whole, not the narrow interests of the few with power and influence.","platform-4-h":"Less Spending, Lower Taxes","platform-5-p":"Ronald Reagan once observed &#x22;As government expands, liberty contracts.&#x22; Every dollar the city spends is a dollar it had to take from the people. Every dollar taken reduces the freedom that citizens have to determine for themselves how to spend their wages. The people of Pocatello deserve a city government that spends their money wisely and efficiently, and takes as little as possible.<br><br>Under the current administration, the city budget has expanded every year and is now far beyond what our city&#x27;s tax base can support. Every year for the past twelve years city taxes have gone up. The median household income of Pocatello is the lowest in Southeast Idaho, but we pay the most in property taxes per citizen. Taxing and spending must come down.<br><br>Getting the budget under control to reduce spending and lower taxes will require courage and leadership. Avoiding tough choices for years is why we have budget deficits and are burning through the city&#x27;s cash reserves. Reducing city spending can be accomplished by making the city more efficient and right-sizing the workforce through natural attrition. However, it will also require a hard look at the size and scope of city government.<br><br>As mayor I will lead the effort to reduce spending and lower our taxes. I will not kick the can down the road. If we do not make tough choices now, we will only have bad options later. I will lead with courage and do what is necessary.","platform-6-h":"More Freedom","platform-7-p":"The central purpose of government is to protect the rights of the people. As mayor I will never impose lockdowns. Every job and business is essential, because every job puts food on someone&#x27;s table. No more mandates or pressure to wear masks or get vaccines. We should be allowed to make our own private medical decisions without force or intimidation.<br><br>A forgotten principle of our nation&#x27;s founding is that government officers have a right and a duty to protect the people they serve from the tyranny of a higher level of government. I will restore this principle to our city. I will never use the power of the police or any other city resource to impose an immoral or unconstitutional law or executive order from the state or federal government.<br><br>The Republic must be restored, one city, county, and state at a time.
