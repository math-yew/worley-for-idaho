      <p class="paragraph-4 first">All government officers, elected and unelected, can justly govern only by the consent of the governed. In a Republic, the people choose their leaders at the ballot box, but also have a fundamental right to be involved in what their government does throughout an elected leader’s term of office.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-4 first">City Hall belongs to the people. Time and space for public comment must be expanded and COVID-19 must not be used as an excuse to shut the people out. As your mayor I will ensure your voice is heard and I will fight for you in your city government.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-4 first">As mayor I will task city officials with generating clear and concise reports that make it easy for the common citizen to see how and where their hard-earned tax dollars are being spent. I will also clearly identify whom city spending and policies benefit and whom they hurt. The citizens of Pocatello have a right to know how city policy actually impacts their community.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-4 first">As your mayor I will serve the city as a whole, not the narrow interests of the few with power and influence.</p>

      <div class="section-title-group platform">
        <div class="section-subheading center platform lighter">Less Spending, Lower Taxes</div>
      </div>
      <p class="paragraph-4 lighter">Ronald Reagan once observed “As government expands, liberty contracts.” Every dollar the city spends is a dollar it had to take from the people. Every dollar taken reduces the freedom that citizens have to determine for themselves how to spend their wages. The people of Pocatello deserve a city government that spends their money wisely and efficiently, and takes as little as possible.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-4 lighter">Under the current administration, the city budget has expanded every year and is now far beyond what our city’s tax base can support. Every year for the past twelve years city taxes have gone up. The median household income of Pocatello is the lowest in Southeast Idaho, but we pay the most in property taxes per citizen. Taxing and spending must come down.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-4 lighter">Getting the budget under control to reduce spending and lower taxes will require courage and leadership. Avoiding tough choices for years is why we have budget deficits and are burning through the city’s cash reserves. Reducing city spending can be accomplished by making the city more efficient and right-sizing the workforce through natural attrition. However, it will also require a hard look at the size and scope of city government.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-4 lighter">As mayor I will lead the effort to reduce spending and lower our taxes. I will not kick the can down the road. If we do not make tough choices now, we will only have bad options later. I will lead with courage and do what is necessary.</p>

        <div class="section-subheading center platform">More Freedom</div>
      </div>
      <p class="paragraph-4 last">The central purpose of government is to protect the rights of the people. As mayor I will never impose lockdowns. Every job and business is essential, because every job puts food on someone’s table. No more mandates or pressure to wear masks or get vaccines. We should be allowed to make our own private medical decisions without force or intimidation.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-4 last">A forgotten principle of our nation’s founding is that government officers have a right and a duty to protect the people they serve from the tyranny of a higher level of government. I will restore this principle to our city. I will never use the power of the police or any other city resource to impose an immoral or unconstitutional law or executive order from the state or federal government.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-4 last">The Republic must be restored, one city, county, and state at a time. Let’s do our part here in Pocatello.</p>
